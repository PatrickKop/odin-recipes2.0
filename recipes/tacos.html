        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the beef to the skillet and cook, 
            crumbling with a spoon or spatula, until browned. Drain any excess grease from the skillet. 
            (If you used 90% or 93% lean ground beef there may not be any extra grease to drain.)</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, dried oregano, 
            onion powder, salt, pepper, tomato sauce and water to the skillet. 
            Stir to combine and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, until taco meat is fully cooked and has 
            reached your desired texture.</li>
        <li>Serve the taco meat in warmed tortillas, with toppings as desired.</li>
    </ol>
